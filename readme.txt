Through Share Shiksha we aim to bring positive change to our present education system. Schools in rural India are in a dire need for resources like teachers and labs , we provide an option for these schools to share their resources and in turn avail resources of other nearby schools. We also aim to bring transparency between the government and schools by providing a transparent grievance forwarding mechanism among other features like community involvement platform.
